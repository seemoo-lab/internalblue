        Broadcom and Cypress chips can extend the "Event Type" field in LE Advertising
        Reports with information on the channel, antenna, and scan mode.

        Parsing this enhanced advertisement report is "documented" in the PacketDecoder
        binary of Apple's PacketLogger, which is part of the Additional Tools for XCode.
        The function parsing these is called `leAdvertisingEventTypeString` (XCode 11.4).

        Usually, the Event Type field is set to 0x00-0x04, meaning ADV_IND..SCAN_RSP.

        Additional fields:
           channel   = (event_type >> 4) & 7
           antenna   = event_type & 0x80
           scan_mode = (event_type >> 3) & 3

        The channel is a value 0--2, which corresponds to 37--39.
        The antenna is 0 for BT and 1 for WLAN.
        No idea about the scan mode ;)

        The Broadcom and Cypress firmware sets these additional fields when the firmware
        flag `bEnhancedAdvReport` is set. We do not know how to set it via VSC HCI and if that
        is possible, so we set it by directly writing to RAM.

              the current LMP version, as it changes with each macOS patch level.

        Won't Fix:
        * The Nexus 5 BLE implementation is too old, `lculp_HandleScanReport` (0x184D0) and
          `_scanTaskRxHeaderDone` (0x16E74) do not reference this flag yet.
        * Also seems to be missing in the Nexus 6P/Samsung Galaxy S6 but didn't check as careful.
