Firmware Versions
=================

This package adds support for different Broadcom and Cypress firmware versions.
A list of known versions can be found below, however we only have firmware information on a subset of these.
Results are based on real world testing, this list is very incomplete. If you know more versions, input is appreciated.

Matching of vendor and version number see list of [Bluetooth versions](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/link-manager) and [company identifiers](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers).

There are more popular devices with Broadcom chips, i.e. many Lenovos, Acers, Sonys, Toshibas, HPs, Azurewares, ... see [this list](https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware/blob/master/DEVICES.md), but we did not see these in the wild yet and do not know their LMP subversion.  


Known Issues
------------

There is a couple of issues causing trouble running *InternalBlue*, which are related to certain firmware versions.

* BCM4335C0
  * Diagnostic messages lack behind by one. If you send `diag c1` you will not get a response. Followed by `diag c2` you will get a response for `c1`, and so on. This issue is independent from the Android driver patch, i.e. a Nexus 6P works perfectly with the same LineageOS 14.1 patch that causes this issue on a Nexus 5. 
* BCM4358A3
  * `Launch_RAM` crashes the firmware if it received another HCI command within the next ~6 seconds. When patching and launching scripts, close the Bluetooth overview from the operating system to prevent scanning and hope that nothing else interacts with this. 
* CYW20735B1
  * `Launch_RAM` works in principle, but threading seems to be broken if the executed code generates other HCI events.
  A hook at `0xB0316` is a nice spot to implement a function that generates HCI events and can be called via the HCI command `0xfc19`.
  The general solution seems to be `self.internalblue.patchRom(0x3d32e, "\x70\x47\x70\x47")` respectively `patch -a 0x3d32e --asm bx lr`, which fixes that the baud rate is set to a wrong value during `Launch_RAM`.
  
Firmware Version and Build Date
-------------------------------

Broadcom internally uses different firmware versions than chip names. For example, the *BCM4339* chip in the *Nexus 5* 
is internally called *BCM4335C0*. It is known to be a revision of the older *BCM4335* chip.

On newer chips, the build information is located in the beginning of the stack. To see it, simply enter
